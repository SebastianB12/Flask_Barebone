# Flask_Barebone
Minimal Flask Setup

Flask Barebone on PythonAnywhere
Flask is a lightweight â€¦..

I use this Barbone for every Flask project as a starting point:
Projectfolder
    -app
        -main
        -static
        -templates
        -__init__.py
    -config.py
    -run.py


Let's go through all files to understand what happens in each file:

The starting file of the flask applicaiton in this case is "run.py" (It does not have to be named like that, it can has every name you want.)
